It is intended for all sorts of software professionals, from developers, UX professionals, software team leads to manager to use within their own software projects and find gender-inclusivity "bugs" so as to resolve those bugs. More information on the method itself can be found [here](http://gendermag.org/downloadables/genderMag-flyer.pdf).

## How does the GenderMag Recorder Assistant relate to GenderMag? 
GenderMag is a method used to find gender-inclusivity issues in software. This is the process on which the Gender Mag Recroder’s open source tool is based. However, GenderMag is a socio-technical method and requires following certain steps. The tool is used to automate some of the steps of this process. 

It is easy to use and can be used by software engineers to management to usability experts.

If you want to help make software gender-inclusive, one way is to contribute to the GenderMag Recorder’s Assistant. 

We welcome everyone with any background to contribute to making the world of software more gender inclusive.
